# About this Repository 📚🎉

This repository is designed to showcase the following technologies whilst carrying out various tests, checking UK (GB) postcodes, and various returns from the API:

- **Java** ☕: The code is written in Java, which is a widely used programming language known for its object-oriented structure and platform independence.
- **JUnit** 🧪: JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java. The @Test annotations are part of JUnit and indicate that the annotated methods are test cases.
- **WireMock** 🕸️: WireMock is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs. It allows you to stay productive when an API you depend on doesn’t exist or isn’t complete. It supports testing of edge cases and failure modes that the real API won’t reliably produce. The WireMockRule is a JUnit rule that manages the lifecycle of a WireMock server.
- **RestAssured** 🌐: RestAssured is a Java library for testing and validating REST services. It provides a DSL that lets you write HTTP requests in a readable and concise manner. The given(), when(), get(), then(), and assertThat() methods are part of RestAssured.
- **Hamcrest** 🎯: Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, and it also has a library of useful matchers. The equalTo() and hasSize() methods are part of Hamcrest and are used to assert that the actual value matches the expected value.

The code samples invoke the Zippopotam.us API.
